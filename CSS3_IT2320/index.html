<h2>Horse Head Nebula</h2>
<div class="div1"></div>
<p>The Horsehead Nebula is around 1,500 light years from Earth and is located near Orion Belt.
Due to its recognizable shape this Nebula is one of the most famous celestial objects.
The Horsehead Nebula is categorized as a dark nebula composed mainly of hydrogen gas and high levels of dust blocking out background light.

<h2>Orion Nebula</h2>
<div class="div2"></div>
<p>Orion Nebula, bright diffuse nebula in the constellation Orion.
It is located near the middle of the sword hanging from Orion's belt.
It is about 1,000 light-years distant and as many as 60 light-years in diameter.
The Orion Nebula appears to be a faint star through the naked eye but becomes a vague patch of light when viewed through binoculars.
The bright region is divided into two sections, the northeast portion being cataloged separately as M43 or NGC 1982.</p>

<h2>Rosette Nebula</h2>
<div class="div3"></div>
<p>The Rosette Nebula is located about 5,000 light years from Earth.
Rosette nebula is found in the constellation Monoceros.
The Rosette Nebula is a prominent star formation region, glowing due to ultraviolet light from the young, hot, blue stars whose winds also cleared the central hole </p>

<h2>Eagle Nebula</h2>
<div class="div4"></div>
<p>The Eagle Nebula is 9.5 light-years high, about twice the distance from our Sun to the next nearest star.
Eagle Nebula is a 5.5 million-year-old cloud of molecular hydrogen gas.
The Eagle Nebula lies 6,500 light-years away in the inner spiral arm of the Milky Way. </p>

<h2>Helix Nebula</h2>
<div class="div5"></div>
<p>The Helix Nebula has been nicknamed the “Eye of God”.
Astronomers have estimated its distance to only be 700 light-years away from Earth.
The Helix Nebula that we see today is just a momentary phase in the death of the star.
The central star of the Helix Nebula was once a star very similar to our own Sun.
The central star is destined to become a white dwarf star, as it cools down slowly. </p>
