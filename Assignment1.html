         <h3>Grace and Jordan</h3>

         <p>Here is Grace and Jordan. Grace is on the left side she is my 6 year old daughter. Jordan on the right is my 3 year old daughter. This is them at the Aquarium in downtown Cleveland. They enjoyed all the new fish and were excited to see the sharks. When we were walking in the tunnel, one of the sharks swam right above us. Grace and Jordan got very scared and started screaming.</p>
